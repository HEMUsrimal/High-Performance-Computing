This systematic evaluation compares the computational performance of three major 
Linux distributions under constrained resource conditions, categorizing their 
capabilities into three distinct performance tiers: 
Tested Distributions: 
• Ubuntu Server (v6.12.25) 
• Kali Linux (v6.11.0-26) 
• Ubuntu Desktop (v5.15.0-142
